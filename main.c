/* # BANKER'S Algorthim
 *
 * For this projet, you will write a multithreaded program that implements 
 * the banker's algorithm discussed in Section 7.5.3. Several customers request
 * and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant a request only 
 * if it leaves the system in a safe state. A request that leaves the system in
 * an unsafe state will be deniced. The programming assignment combines
 * three separate topics: 
 *  1) Multithreading 
 *  2) preventing race conditions
 *  3) deadlock Avoidance
 *
 * ## The Banker
 * The banker consider requests from `n` customers from 
 * `m` resources types (section 7.5.3). The banker will keep track of the
 * resource using the following data structures.
 *
 * TODO
