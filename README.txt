In this project you will implement the Bankerâ€™s problem described in Chapter 7 of your book (p345/346). Use the Pthreads library and the VM that you built in HMW 1 to complete this project.

 

You may assume that you have three resources with the following number of instances (available array)
The number of customers, n, can vary.
Initialize your maximum array with random numbers less than available array
Every time you make an allocation show the following

Indicate whether the request was successful or denied
In your report show an example of a denied request and a granted request and explain the results. Why was the request denied or granted.
